    <h1>The Best Movie According to Diana</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies off all-time <a href="../index.html">‚ù§</a></h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Hunger Games: Catching FIre</h3>
    <p>This movie, for me, among all three from the original saga,
    is the best at creating emotions. Visual effects are amazing 
    and the main topic represents perfectly the sense of cruelty
    from the Capitol
    </p>

    <h3>Avatar</h3>
    <p>Made me imagine. Emotions are always on the surface</p>

    <h3>Incredibles</h3>
    <p>Very dinamic, love the family adventure.</p>
